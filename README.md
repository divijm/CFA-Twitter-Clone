# CFA-Twitter-Clone - Froggy

## Problem

Our project was to clone the basic functionality of Twitter. To decide what features were essential, we applied Agile Methodologies and came up with user stories

## Solution

Though it hasn't been styled properly, this was a very good project to build a good understanding of the MVC structure on Rails! The app models Twitter by having the ability to tweet and also having comments on the tweets! It also user user login setup through the Devise gem!

All tweets:

## Challenges

Having the comments functionality in this app was definitely the trickiest challenge. It involved understanding the MVC structure well and also understanding how routing works in the Rails framework! 

### That's it for now folks!
